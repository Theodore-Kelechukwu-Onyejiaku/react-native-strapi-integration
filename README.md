``` bash
cd server
npm run develop
```

You will be greeted with the **Admin Create Account** screen.

![003-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/003_strapi_5_0ec1eaaa6a.png)

Go ahead and create your first Strapi user.  All of this is local so you can use whatever you want.

Once you have created your user, you will be redirected to the **Strapi Dashboard** screen.

![004-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/004_strapi_5_87bc6d8f39.png)

### Publish Article Entries
Since we created our app with the example data, you should be able to navigate to your **Article** collection and see the data that was created for us.

![005-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/005_strapi_5_dc3a4a7540.png)

Now, let's make sure that all of the data is **published**.  If not, you can select all items via the checkbox and then click the **Publish** button.

![Strapi Articles Published](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/006_strapi_5_9c6055ac59.png)

### Enable API Access
Once all your articles are published, we will expose our Strapi API for the **Articles Collection**. This can be done in ***Settings -> Users & Permissions plugin -> Roles -> Public -> Article***.

You should have `find` and `findOne` selected.  If not, go ahead and select them.

![007-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/007_strapi_5_edd775db5f.png)

### Test API 
Now, if we make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:1337/api/articles`, we should see the following data for our articles.

![008-strapi-5.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/008_strapi_5_66883c2963.png)

> üñêÔ∏è Note: The article covers (images) are not returned. This is because the REST API by default does not populate any relations, media fields, components, or dynamic zones.. Learn more about [REST API: Population & Field Selection](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/populate-select).


So, let's get the article covers by using the `populate=*` parameter: `http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*`

![strapi integration - api request.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/vuejs_strapi_integration_api_request_c748d16c83.png)

Nice, now that we have our Strapi 5 server setup, we can start to setup our React Native application.

## Getting Started With React Native
We will use [Expo Dev](https://expo.dev/) for this integration. Expo Dev is an open-source development environment provided by Expo that allows developers to build native mobile apps for Android and iOS using JavaScript.

### Prerequisites
Consider having the following tools to get started:
* [X-Code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Android Emulator or iOS Emulator
* Optionally, a physical device.

See expo docs for more [setup instructions](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/).

### Install React Native
Install React Native using the command below:

```bash
npx create-expo-app react-native-project --template blank
```

### Start a Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

If successful, this is what you will see in your terminal:

![Start React Native Development Server.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/Start_React_Native_Development_Server_f3fdcf2010.png)


## Running Your App on a Device
To test and run your app on a device, you can do it in the following ways:

* **Web**: Press `w` in your terminal to open the app on your web browser.
* **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in your terminal to start your Android emulator.
* **iOS Simulator**: Type `i` in your terminal to start your iOS simulator.
* **Physical Device**: Ensure you have the **Expo Go** app installed on your physical device. 

See more about [setting up your environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/).

> üñêÔ∏è **NOTE:** For this integration, we will make use of the **Android emulator** and the **iOS simulator**.

After setting up your environment, here is what your application should look like:

### Android Emulator 
![Android Emulator.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/Android_Emulator_d1e18f2862.png)
*Android Emulator*

### iOS Emulator
![iOS Simulator.png](https://delicate-dawn-ac25646e6d.media.strapiapp.com/i_OS_Simulator_baf6b57173.png)
*iOS Emulator*

## Use an HTTP Client For Requests
Many HTTP clients are available, but on this integration page, we'll use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Using Axios
Install Axios by running any of the commands below:

```bash
# npm
npm i axios
```

Or:

```bash
# yarn
yarn add axios
```

### Using Fetch
No installation is needed.

## Fetch Articles from Strapi Backend
Execute a `GET` request on the **Article** collection type in order to fetch all your articles.

Be sure that you activated the find permission for the Article collection type.

> **üñêÔ∏è NOTE:** We want to also fetch covers (images) of articles, so we have to use the populate parameter as seen below.

### Using Axios

```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*");
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data);
```

### Using Fetch

```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:1337/api/articles?populate=*");
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data);
```

## Example Project
We will create an app that fetches articles from a Strapi backend and displays them in a grid layout.

Navigate to your React Native entry file `./App.js` and carry out the steps below:

### Step 1: Import Required Dependencies
```javascript
import {
  View,
  Text,
  Image,
  FlatList,
  StyleSheet,
} from "react-native";
import axios from "axios";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
```
* `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `FlatList`, and `StyleSheet` are core React Native components used for structuring the layout, displaying text, images, and styling the app.
* `useEffect` and `useState` are React hooks which manages component state and handles side effects respectively.

### Step 2: Create Variables

Create a constant variable, `STRAPI_URL,` that defines the base URL for the Strapi backend and another variable, `articles` that will hold the list of articles fetched from the Strapi API. 

```javascript
...

// replace with Strapi Production URL
const STRAPI_URL = "http://localhost:1337";

// State to store articles
const [articles, setArticles] = useState([]);

..
```

### Step 3: Create a Function to Fetch Articles
Create a function `fetchArticles` to fetch articles from the Strapi backend and fetch articles once the component is mounted.

```javascript
...

// fetch articles from Strapi
const fetchArticles = async () => {
  try {
    // Fetch articles along with their covers
    const response = await axios.get(`${STRAPI_URL}/api/articles?populate=*`);
    setArticles(response.data.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching articles:", error);
  }
};

// Fetch articles on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  fetchArticles();
}, []);

...
```

### Step 4: Create a Function to Format Published Dates of Articles

Create a `formatDate` function formats the `publishedAt` date of each article into a human-readable `string (e.g., 01/14/2025). It should use the `toLocaleDateString` method with options to display the year, month, and day in an `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

```javascript
... 

// Format date
const formatDate = (date) => {
  const options = { year: "numeric", month: "2-digit", day: "2-digit" };
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", options);
};

...
```

### Step 5: Render Articles
Render individual articles as cards with an image, title, and formatted publication date using the `formatDate` utility function.

```javascript
...

export default function App() {
  ...
  
  // Render article card
  const renderArticle = ({ item }) => (
    <View style={styles.card}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: `${STRAPI_URL}${item.cover.url}` }}
        style={styles.image}
      />
      <Text style={styles.title}>{item.title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.published}>
        Published: {formatDate(item.publishedAt)}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>React Native and Strapi Integration</Text>
      <FlatList
        title="Articles"
        data={articles}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={renderArticle}
        numColumns={2}
        contentContainerStyle={styles.container}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
In the code above, we render a list of articles fetched from Strapi, displayed as cards in a two-column grid using `FlatList`. Each card includes an image, title, and formatted publication date styled using the styles object. The `renderArticle` function defines how each article card is displayed.

## Complete Code
```javascript
// Path: ./App.js

export default function App() {
  // replace with Strapi Production URL
  const STRAPI_URL = "http://localhost:1337";

  // State to store articles
  const [articles, setArticles] = useState([]);

  // fetch articles from Strapi
  const fetchArticles = async () => {
    try {
      // Fetch articles along with their covers
      const response = await axios.get(`${STRAPI_URL}/api/articles?populate=*`);
      setArticles(response.data.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching articles:", error);
    }
  };

  // Format date
  const formatDate = (date) => {
    const options = { year: "numeric", month: "2-digit", day: "2-digit" };
    return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString("en-US", options);
  };

  // Render article card
  const renderArticle = ({ item }) => (
    <View style={styles.card}>
      <Image
        source={{ uri: `${STRAPI_URL}${item.cover.url}` }}
        style={styles.image}
      />
      <Text style={styles.title}>{item.title}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.published}>
        Published: {formatDate(item.publishedAt)}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );

  // Fetch articles on component mount
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchArticles();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.heading}>React Native and Strapi Integration</Text>
      <FlatList
        title="Articles"
        data={articles}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
        renderItem={renderArticle}
        numColumns={2}
        contentContainerStyle={styles.container}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

```

Here is a break-down of the code above:

* The `fetchArticles` function retrieves data from the Strapi API, including article covers, titles, and publication dates, and stores them in the articles state using useState.
* The `renderArticle` function renders individual articles as cards with an image, title, and formatted publication date using the `formatDate` utility function.
* The `useEffect` hook runs `fetchArticles` on component mount to ensure data is loaded when the app starts.
* The `FlatList` displays the articles in two columns, with the app styled using a custom StyleSheet for a clean, responsive layout.
* This `StyleSheet` defines the layout and styling for your app. The `container` ensures the main screen has proper padding and fills the space, while `card` styles each item with a rounded, shadowed design. The `image`, `title`, and `published` handle the card's content, ensuring images are proportional, titles are bold, and dates are subtle. The `heading` styles the main title to be bold, centered, and spaced from the top.

Here is how our app should look:

Awesome, great job!

## Having Problems?
If you are unable to run your app on your device, here are a few solutions:

* For Android Simulator, change the `STRAPI_URL` to `http://10.0.2.2:1337`.
* For devices, make sure you are on the same Wi-Fi network.

See this [Expo page](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/#having-problems) for more information.
